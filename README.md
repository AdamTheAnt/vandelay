# Vandelay industries

This docker image is in the LaTeX import/export business.  It is based on a [Centos](https://hub.docker.com/_/centos/) 7 docker image.

The LaTeX installation packaged by CentOS doesn't allow you to manually install packages from CTAN.  This image uses texlive to manage LaTeX packages so you can install any packages you need since it bypasses the CentOS packages.

We're looking to [hire George Costanza as our latex salesman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T35QhLx_KI).
